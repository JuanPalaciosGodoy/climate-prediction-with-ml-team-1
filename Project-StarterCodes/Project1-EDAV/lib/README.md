# # Project 1: Exploring Hurricane Tracks and Climate Change

### Code lib Folder

The lib directory contains all the code necessary to run our project story. A description of the important files is below.

- `func_tools`: This directory contains multiple python files with functions that are called in the data story. This is to keep the data story more visually clean (instead of putting many functions at the beginning).
- `data_story`: This notebook is our data story and the main deliverable from our project.
