+ Project summary: In this project, explore connections between hurricane clustering and large-scale, interannual climate conditions. In particular, we investigated whether adding an additional input to the clustering algorithm (power dissipation index - PDI) improves the clusters correlation with ENSO/NAO. During this course of this exploration, we tried using different clustering algorithms (K-Means, DBScan, and Gaussian Mixture Models) and different time intervals of hurricane data.
  
**Contribution statement**: ([more information and examples](doc/a_note_on_contributions.md))

SP, JP, AK, and AMF collaboratively designed the study. AMF worked on comparing clusters using data from different time intervals to determine which data to input to the clustering algorithm. AMF drafted the outline of the data story and all team members added results from their section.
